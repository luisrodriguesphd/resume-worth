"""     Fast Start Example #6 - RAG - Beyond the Basics

    This example builds upon examples #4 and #5 and demonstrates how to layer additional elements to
    improve the effectiveness of a RAG workflow over a larger set of documents-

    1.  Apply an initial filter across a batch of documents to identify a subset of documents of interest
    2.  Analyze the documents of interest to identify key provisions
    3.  Use fact-checking and post-processing to validate the accuracy of the LLM response
    4.  Write the output to JSON and CSV files for follow-up review and/or the next step in the workflow.

    For this example, we also recommend using a more sophisticated DRAGON model in GGUF format, which enables us
    to run 6-7B parameter models locally.
